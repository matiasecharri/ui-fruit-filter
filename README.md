   Building on the previous point, items are dynamically generated, acquiring additional qualities based on their properties.

3. **Cross Filters** 🔍
   Users can combine two types of search filters to facilitate their search and enhance their experience within the application.

4. **Shopping Cart Management** 🛒
   Each item has buttons to add or remove it from the cart, and the quantity is based on its stock, which updates based on user actions.

5. **Dark Mode / Light Mode** 🌗
   The ability to switch between two themes depending on the user's preferences.

6. **Interactive Sounds** 🔊
   Interactive sound effects enhance the user experience and create a memorable interface.
